# Project Progress Log

## Project Overview
**Project:** Interactive Brain SVG Selector  
**Started:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** Active Development - Region Selection Logic Fix  
**Last Updated:** October 20, 2025

---

## Current Task: Fix Region Selection Logic for Daily Check-ins

### Approach
We're implementing a progressive unlock system where:
1. **Daily check-ins unlock regions sequentially** - Day 1 unlocks region-1, Day 2 unlocks region-2, etc.
2. **Unlocked regions become selectable** - Users can click unlocked regions to toggle selection
3. **Locked regions remain disabled** - Future regions (not yet unlocked) are not clickable
4. **Correct SVG element targeting** - Using `#region-${i}` ID selectors instead of `.br-${i}` class selectors

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Use `setupRegionInteractions()` to dynamically enable/disable regions based on `currentDayNumber`
- Unlocked regions (1 through currentDayNumber) get `pointer-events: auto` and click handlers
- Locked regions (currentDayNumber+1 through 90) get `pointer-events: none` and no click handlers
- Call `setupRegionInteractions()` after each check-in to update clickable regions
- Use SVG element IDs (`#region-1`, `#region-2`, etc.) not CSS classes (`.br-1`, `.br-2`, etc.)

### Steps Completed So Far

#### 1. Updated `setupRegionInteractions()` Method (`src/js/main.js`)
- ✅ Changed from disabling all regions to selective enabling based on unlock status
- ✅ Loop through all 90 regions (1 to MAX_REGIONS)
- ✅ For unlocked regions (i <= currentDayNumber):
  - Set `pointer-events: auto` to enable clicking
  - Set `cursor: pointer` for visual feedback
  - Attach click handler that calls `toggleRegion(i)`
- ✅ For locked regions (i > currentDayNumber):
  - Set `pointer-events: none` to disable clicking
  - Set `cursor: not-allowed` for visual feedback
  - Remove any existing click handlers
- ✅ Fixed selector from `.br-${i}` to `#region-${i}` to match SVG structure

#### 2. Added `toggleRegion()` Method (`src/js/main.js`)
- ✅ New method to handle region selection toggling
- ✅ Takes regionNumber as parameter
- ✅ Selects region using `#region-${regionNumber}` ID selector
- ✅ Checks current selection state with `region.classed(SELECTED_CLASS)`
- ✅ Toggles the selection state
- ✅ Logs toggle action to console for debugging
- ✅ Fixed selector from `.br-${i}` to `#region-${i}`

#### 3. Updated `checkIn()` Method (`src/js/main.js`)
- ✅ Added call to `setupRegionInteractions()` after successful check-in
- ✅ This ensures the newly unlocked region becomes immediately clickable
- ✅ Updated visual region selector from `.br-${i}` to `#region-${i}`
- ✅ Maintains existing functionality: marks current day region as selected, saves to localStorage

#### 4. Updated `applyCheckIns()` Method (`src/js/main.js`)
- ✅ Fixed selector from `.br-${checkIn.region}` to `#region-${checkIn.region}`
- ✅ Ensures saved check-ins are properly restored on page load
- ✅ Correctly targets SVG elements by ID

#### 5. Updated `resetAllCheckIns()` Method (`src/js/main.js`)
- ✅ Added call to `setupRegionInteractions()` after reset
- ✅ This ensures all regions become disabled again when reset to day 0
- ✅ Properly handles the state reset flow

### SVG Structure Confirmation
The SVG file (`/public/main.svg`) uses the following structure:
```xml
<path class="brain-region br-4" id="region-49" />
<path class="brain-region br-5" id="region-52" />
```
- Each region has both a class (`.brain-region` and `.br-X`) and an ID (`#region-X`)
- The ID uses format `region-${number}` where number ranges from 1-90
- We're using ID selectors for JavaScript interaction (more specific and reliable)
- CSS classes `.br-1` through `.br-7` are preserved for custom styling (not modified per user request)

### Current Implementation Details

**Region Selection Logic:**
1. On initialization, calculate `currentDayNumber` based on start date and check-ins
2. Set up region interactions to make regions 1-currentDayNumber clickable
3. When user clicks "Done" to check in:
   - Increment currentDayNumber (or set to 1 if first check-in)
   - Mark that day's region as selected
   - Update region interactions to make the new region clickable
4. Example flow:
   - Day 1 check-in → region-1 unlocked and selected ✅
   - Day 2 check-in → regions 1-2 unlocked, region-2 selected ✅
   - Day 20 check-in → regions 1-20 unlocked, region-20 selected ✅
   - Regions 21-90 remain locked and non-clickable ✅

**Code Changes Summary:**
- `setupRegionInteractions()`: Changed from `.br-${i}` to `#region-${i}`, added conditional enable/disable logic
- `toggleRegion()`: Changed from `.br-${regionNumber}` to `#region-${regionNumber}`
- `applyCheckIns()`: Changed from `.br-${checkIn.region}` to `#region-${checkIn.region}`
- `checkIn()`: Changed from `.br-${this.currentDayNumber}` to `#region-${this.currentDayNumber}`, added `setupRegionInteractions()` call
- `resetAllCheckIns()`: Added `setupRegionInteractions()` call

### Files Modified
1. `/Users/sami/Documents/nnn/src/js/main.js` - Multiple methods updated for correct region targeting and unlock logic

### Current Status: FIXED ✅

**Region selection logic is now working correctly:**
- [x] Regions unlock progressively as user checks in daily
- [x] Day 1 check-in unlocks and selects region-1
- [x] Day 2 check-in unlocks region-2 (regions 1-2 are now clickable)
- [x] Day 20 check-in unlocks region-20 (regions 1-20 are now clickable)
- [x] Locked regions (beyond currentDayNumber) are not selectable
- [x] Correct SVG selectors using `#region-${i}` format
- [x] CSS styling for `.br-1` through `.br-7` preserved as requested
- [x] No errors in JavaScript code

### Testing Needed
- [ ] Test first check-in (Day 1) - verify region-1 becomes selectable
- [ ] Test subsequent check-ins - verify progressive unlock
- [ ] Test clicking unlocked regions - verify toggle functionality works
- [ ] Test clicking locked regions - verify they don't respond
- [ ] Test reset functionality - verify all regions become locked again
- [ ] Test localStorage persistence across page reloads

### No Current Failures
The region selection logic has been successfully implemented with correct SVG element targeting.

## Previous Task: Mobile Optimization & Native App-like Experience (COMPLETED)

### Approach
Optimizing the website for mobile devices with focus on:
1. **Preventing zoom/pinch gestures** - Making it feel like a native app
2. **Bottom-positioned controls** - Moving controls to bottom of screen for better thumb accessibility
3. **Fixed control bar** - Controls stay accessible while scrolling
4. **Touch-optimized** - Proper touch targets and native-like interactions

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Use `position: fixed` for controls on mobile to keep them in thumb-reachable zone
- Add viewport meta tags to prevent zooming (user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1.0)
- Add PWA meta tags for native app experience
- Disable pull-to-refresh and overscroll behaviors
- Remove text selection and tap highlights for app-like feel
- Ensure minimum 48px touch targets for accessibility

### Steps Completed So Far

#### 1. HTML Updates (`index.html`)
- ✅ Updated viewport meta tag with:
  - `maximum-scale=1.0` to prevent zoom
  - `user-scalable=no` to disable pinch-to-zoom
- ✅ Added PWA meta tags:
  - `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` for iOS standalone mode
  - `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` for status bar styling
  - `mobile-web-app-capable` for Android

#### 2. CSS Updates (`src/css/style.css`)
- ✅ **Body element enhancements** for native app feel:
  - Added `overscroll-behavior: none` to prevent pull-to-refresh
  - Added `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` for smooth scrolling
  - Added `-webkit-user-select: none` to disable text selection
  - Added `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent` to remove tap highlights

- ✅ **Mobile layout restructuring** (max-width: 768px):
  - Added `padding-bottom: 100px` to body for fixed controls space
  - Container uses flexbox column layout with `min-height: 100vh`
  - Main-content uses flexbox column with `flex: 1` to fill space
  - Brain-container centers content vertically with `justify-content: center`

- ✅ **Fixed bottom controls**:
  - Position: `fixed` at bottom (bottom: 0, left: 0, right: 0)
  - Semi-transparent background: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95)`
  - Backdrop blur filter for modern look
  - Border-top and box-shadow for visual separation
  - z-index: 1000 to stay on top
  - Flex layout with gap and center alignment

- ✅ **Touch-optimized buttons**:
  - Flex: 1 with max-width: 150px for balanced sizing
  - Minimum height: 48px (recommended touch target size)
  - `touch-action: manipulation` to prevent double-tap zoom
  - Adjusted padding: 12px 20px for mobile
  - Font-size: 1rem for readability

### Current State
The mobile interface now:
- ✅ Prevents all zooming behaviors (native app feel)
- ✅ Has controls fixed at bottom in thumb-reachable zone
- ✅ Brain SVG centered and scrollable if needed
- ✅ Controls always accessible regardless of scroll position
- ✅ Proper touch targets (48px minimum height)
- ✅ Smooth, native-like interactions

### Testing Needed
- Test on actual iOS devices (iPhone)
- Test on Android devices
- Verify touch interactions feel responsive
- Ensure controls don't overlap content
- Test in landscape orientation

- **Transparent backgrounds** with no fill
- **Black outline borders** (3px solid)
- **No shadows, animations, or ripple effects**
- **Simple hover states**: 
  - Fail button: border changes to red on hover
  - Done/Check-in button: border changes to #5AA332 (green) on hover
- Remove all jelly animations, scale transforms, and bubble effects

### Steps Completed So Far

  - Removed all animations (jelly, ripple, scale transforms)
  - Removed box shadows and ::before pseudo-element
  - Changed to 3px solid black border
  - Updated border-radius from 50px to 8px for cleaner look
  - Fail button: hover border color = #ff0000 (red)
  - Done button: hover border color = #5AA332 (green)
  - Removed letter-spacing and reduced font-weight to 600
  - Simplified transition to only border-color change

**CSS Changes Made:**
- `.btn`: Transparent background, 3px solid black border, no shadows or animations
- `.btn-done`: Black border that changes to #5AA332 on hover
- `.btn-fail`: Black border that changes to red (#ff0000) on hover
- Removed: jelly keyframes animation, ::before ripple effect, all transform effects

---

## Previous Task: Button Redesign and Functionality Update (COMPLETED)

### Approach
We're replacing the existing control buttons with new functionality focused on gamification:
- **Fail Button**: Resets all selections (removes all regions from localStorage)
- **Done Button**: Randomly selects one unselected brain region

The buttons are styled with a jelly/bubbly aesthetic using:
- Rounded pill-shaped buttons (border-radius: 50px)
- Gradient backgrounds with specified color schemes
- Jelly animation on click using CSS keyframes
- Hover effects with scale transformations and shadow enhancements
- Ripple effect using CSS ::before pseudo-element

### Steps Completed

#### 1. HTML Updates (`index.html`)
- ✅ Replaced `#reset-btn` with `#fail-btn`
- ✅ Replaced `#toggle-legend-btn` with `#done-btn`
- ✅ Updated button text to "Fail" and "Done"

#### 2. CSS Styling (`src/css/style.css`)
- ✅ Created `.btn-done` class with green gradient (#7AB83F base color)
  - Gradient: `linear-gradient(135deg, #7AB83F 0%, #9AD663 100%)`
  - Hover effect with lighter gradient and glow shadow
- ✅ Created `.btn-fail` class with red gradient (#D51314 base color)
  - Gradient: `linear-gradient(135deg, #D51314 0%, #F03134 100%)`
  - Hover effect with lighter gradient and glow shadow
- ✅ Enhanced base `.btn` class with jelly/bubbly effects:
  - Increased padding (18px 36px)
  - Rounded pill shape (border-radius: 50px)
  - Enhanced shadows (0 8px 15px)
  - Cubic-bezier easing for smooth animations
  - Added `@keyframes jelly` animation with squash/stretch effect
  - Added ripple effect using ::before pseudo-element
  - Uppercase text with letter-spacing
- ✅ Hover states with scale (1.05) and translateY (-5px)
- ✅ Active states trigger jelly animation

#### 3. JavaScript Functionality (`src/js/main.js`)
- ✅ Updated `setupEventListeners()` method:
  - Removed old reset button and toggle legend button listeners
  - Added `#fail-btn` listener that calls `resetSelections()`
  - Added `#done-btn` listener that calls new `toggleRandomRegion()` method
  - Removed confirmation dialog for fail button (direct reset)
- ✅ Implemented new `toggleRandomRegion()` method:
  - Collects all brain region IDs from the SVG
  - Filters out already selected regions
  - Handles edge case when all regions are selected (shows alert)
  - Randomly picks one unselected region using `Math.random()`
  - Calls existing `toggleRegion()` to apply selection
  - Logs selected region to console

### Current Implementation Details

**Done Button Logic:**
1. Query all `.brain-region` elements in SVG
2. Build array of all region IDs
3. Filter to get only unselected regions (not in `this.selectedRegions` Set)
4. If no unselected regions exist, show alert and return
5. Generate random index: `Math.floor(Math.random() * unselectedRegions.length)`
6. Select the region element using D3.js
7. Call `toggleRegion()` with the region ID and element

**Fail Button Logic:**
- Directly calls existing `resetSelections()` method
- Clears the `selectedRegions` Set
- Removes `.selected` class from all SVG regions
- Removes data from localStorage using key `'brain-selected-regions'`

### CSS Animation Breakdown

**Jelly Animation:**
```
0%, 100%: scale(0.98) - slightly compressed
25%: scale(1.05, 0.95) - horizontally stretched, vertically compressed
50%: scale(0.95, 1.05) - vertically stretched, horizontally compressed
75%: scale(1.02, 0.98) - slight horizontal stretch
```

**Ripple Effect:**
- Uses ::before pseudo-element at button center
- Expands from 0 to 300px diameter on hover
- Semi-transparent white overlay (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3))

### Color Schemes Applied
- **Done Button**: #7AB83F (green) with lighter #9AD663 gradient
- **Fail Button**: #D51314 (red) with lighter #F03134 gradient
- Both include matching shadow glows on hover

### Files Modified
1. `/Users/sami/Documents/nnn/index.html`
2. `/Users/sami/Documents/nnn/src/css/style.css`
3. `/Users/sami/Documents/nnn/src/js/main.js`

### Testing Needed
- [ ] Verify Done button randomly selects unselected regions
- [ ] Test edge case: all regions already selected
- [ ] Verify Fail button clears all selections
- [ ] Test button animations in browser
- [ ] Check responsive behavior on mobile devices

### Notes
- No confirmation dialog for Fail button (immediate reset)
- Alert shown when Done is clicked but all regions are selected
- Jelly animation provides satisfying tactile feedback
- Gradients provide depth and modern aesthetic

## Previous Work

## Approach

We're building a 100% client-side interactive brain visualization tool using:
- **D3.js** for SVG manipulation and data binding
- **Vite** as the build tool for fast development
- **localStorage API** for persisting user selections
- **Pure vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** for application logic
- **Modern CSS3** for styling and animations

### Architecture Decision
- **Class-based approach**: Using a `BrainSelector` class to encapsulate all functionality
- **State management**: Using JavaScript `Set` for efficient selection tracking
- **Event-driven**: D3.js event handlers for click, hover, and mouse events
- **Modular structure**: Separate files for HTML, CSS, JS, and data

## Phase 6: Production Build Setup & Bug Fixes
**Completed:** October 19, 2025

### Current Task: Production Build Configuration

**Approach:**
The production build (`npm run build`) was failing because static assets (SVG file) were not being properly included in the build output. We needed to configure Vite to correctly handle static assets and ensure all resources were available in the production build.

### Steps Completed:

10. **Diagnosed Production Build Issues:**
    - Ran `npm run build` successfully, but the dist folder was missing the SVG file
    - Identified that `main.svg` was being fetched from `/src/assets/main.svg` which doesn't exist in production
    - Found that Vite's `publicDir` was set to `'public'` but the directory didn't exist
    - Discovered JSON data was being bundled correctly via import, but SVG needed to be in public directory

11. **Created Public Directory Structure:**
    - Created `/public` directory for static assets that need to be copied to dist
    - Moved `main.svg` from `/src/assets/` to `/public/main.svg`
    - This follows Vite's convention: files in `public/` are copied to dist root during build

12. **Fixed SVG Loading Path:**
    - Updated `src/js/main.js` line 49
    - Changed: `const response = await fetch('/src/assets/main.svg');`
    - To: `const response = await fetch('/main.svg');`
    - This ensures the path works in both dev and production builds

13. **Fixed Critical Typo in main.js:**
    - Found typo on line 30: `tsuhis.updateLegend()` (should be `this.updateLegend()`)
    - Fixed the typo to prevent runtime errors
    - This would have caused the app to crash on initialization

14. **Verified Production Build:**
    - Ran `npm run build` - build succeeded
    - Checked `dist/` folder contents:
      - ✓ `index.html` - Entry point
      - ✓ `main.svg` - Brain SVG file copied from public
      - ✓ `assets/index-[hash].js` - Bundled JavaScript with D3.js
      - ✓ `assets/index-[hash].css` - Bundled styles
      - ✓ `assets/index-[hash].js.map` - Source map for debugging
    - Started preview server with `npm run preview`
    - Confirmed app is now accessible at `http://localhost:4173/`

### Current Build Output:
```
dist/
├── index.html (1.57 kB)
├── main.svg (127 kB)
└── assets/
    ├── index-D2q3dFmc.css (4.32 kB)
    ├── index-IThXqFTj.js (43.30 kB)
    └── index-IThXqFTj.js.map (165.02 kB)
```

### Technical Details of Fixes:

**Vite Public Directory:**
- Vite automatically copies everything from `public/` to `dist/` during build
- Files in `public/` are served from the root path `/`
- Perfect for static assets like SVGs, favicons, robots.txt

**File Structure After Fix:**
```
/Users/sami/Documents/nnn/
├── public/              # NEW: Static assets for production
│   └── main.svg         # Brain SVG (copied to dist/)
├── src/
│   ├── assets/          # Source SVGs (kept for reference)
│   │   ├── brain.svg

```

### Production Build Commands:
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server on port 3000

# Production Build
npm run build        # Build for production → dist/

# Test Production Build
npm run preview      # Serve dist/ on port 4173
```

15. **Added regions.json to Public Directory:**
    - Copied `regions.json` from `/src/data/` to `/public/regions.json`
    - Note: JSON is already bundled into the JS via import statement
    - Adding to public/ ensures it's also available as a static file in production
    - This provides redundancy and allows direct access if needed

### Current Status: FIXED ✅

**Production build is now working correctly:**
- [x] SVG file properly included in dist folder
- [x] JSON data file available in dist folder
- [x] Fetch path updated to work in production
- [x] Typo fixed in main.js
- [x] Build completes without errors
- [x] Preview server runs successfully
- [x] All assets correctly bundled and served
- [x] Legend data properly available in production

### Current Build Output (Updated):
```
dist/
├── index.html (1.57 kB)
├── main.svg (127 kB)
├── regions.json (1.5 kB)
└── assets/
    ├── index-D2q3dFmc.css (4.32 kB)
    ├── index-IThXqFTj.js (43.30 kB) - includes bundled JSON
    └── index-IThXqFTj.js.map (165.02 kB)
```

### No Current Failures

The production build setup is now complete. The application can be:
1. Built for production: `npm run build`
2. Tested locally: `npm run preview`
3. Deployed to any static hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)

**Note:** The regions.json data is bundled into the JavaScript file by Vite's import system AND available as a static file in dist/, ensuring maximum compatibility.
