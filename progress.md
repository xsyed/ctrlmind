# Project Progress Log

## Project Overview
**Project:** Interactive Brain SVG Selector  
**Started:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** Complete - Ready for Testing  

---

## Approach

We're building a 100% client-side interactive brain visualization tool using:
- **D3.js** for SVG manipulation and data binding
- **Vite** as the build tool for fast development
- **localStorage API** for persisting user selections
- **Pure vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** for application logic
- **Modern CSS3** for styling and animations

### Architecture Decision
- **Class-based approach**: Using a `BrainSelector` class to encapsulate all functionality
- **State management**: Using JavaScript `Set` for efficient selection tracking
- **Event-driven**: D3.js event handlers for click, hover, and mouse events
- **Modular structure**: Separate files for HTML, CSS, JS, and data

---

## Steps Completed

### Phase 1: Project Setup
**Completed:** All infrastructure files created

1. Created folder structure:
   - `/src/assets/` - for SVG files
   - `/src/js/` - for JavaScript
   - `/src/css/` - for styling
   - `/src/data/` - for JSON metadata

2. Set up configuration files:
   - `package.json` - Dependencies (D3.js v7.8.5, Tippy.js v6.3.7, Vite v5.0.0)
   - `vite.config.js` - Vite dev server on port 3000

### Phase 2: SVG and Data
**Completed:** Brain visualization assets ready

3. Created enhanced `brain.svg`:
   - 8 brain regions with unique IDs
   - Each path has `data-region` and `data-name` attributes
   - Built-in CSS for base styling
   - Regions: Frontal Lobe, Parietal Lobe, Temporal Lobe, Occipital Lobe, Cerebellum, Brain Stem, Motor Cortex, Prefrontal Cortex

4. Created `regions.json`:
   - Metadata for all 8 brain regions
   - Includes name, description, and functions
   - Used for tooltips and legend information

### Phase 3: User Interface
**Completed:** All UI components built

5. Built `index.html`:
   - Main container with header
   - Brain SVG container
   - Control buttons (Reset, Toggle Legend)
   - Legend panel with selected regions list
   - All regions list for reference
   - Tooltip container

6. Created comprehensive `style.css`:
   - Modern gradient background (purple theme)
   - Card-based layout with glassmorphism effects
   - Brain region styles (default, hover, selected)
   - Pulse animation for selected regions
   - Responsive grid layout (desktop/mobile)
   - Custom tooltip styling
   - Smooth transitions and animations
   - Custom scrollbar for legend panel

### Phase 4: Application Logic

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
```javascript
class BrainSelector {
  constructor() {
    this.selectedRegions = new Set();  // Efficient selection tracking
    this.regionsMap = new Map();       // Quick metadata lookup
    this.svg = null;                   // D3 SVG selection
  }
}
```

### localStorage Schema
```json
{
  "brain-selected-regions": ["frontal-lobe", "parietal-lobe", ...]
}
```

### D3.js Event Handling
- Used D3's `.on()` method for event binding
- Leveraged D3 selections for efficient DOM updates
- Applied D3 transitions for smooth animations

### CSS Architecture
- Mobile-first responsive design
- CSS Grid for layout
- CSS Custom Properties could be added for theming
- Keyframe animations for visual feedback

## Phase 6: Production Build Setup & Bug Fixes
**Completed:** October 19, 2025

### Current Task: Production Build Configuration

**Approach:**
The production build (`npm run build`) was failing because static assets (SVG file) were not being properly included in the build output. We needed to configure Vite to correctly handle static assets and ensure all resources were available in the production build.

### Steps Completed:

10. **Diagnosed Production Build Issues:**
    - Ran `npm run build` successfully, but the dist folder was missing the SVG file
    - Identified that `main.svg` was being fetched from `/src/assets/main.svg` which doesn't exist in production
    - Found that Vite's `publicDir` was set to `'public'` but the directory didn't exist
    - Discovered JSON data was being bundled correctly via import, but SVG needed to be in public directory

11. **Created Public Directory Structure:**
    - Created `/public` directory for static assets that need to be copied to dist
    - Moved `main.svg` from `/src/assets/` to `/public/main.svg`
    - This follows Vite's convention: files in `public/` are copied to dist root during build

12. **Fixed SVG Loading Path:**
    - Updated `src/js/main.js` line 49
    - Changed: `const response = await fetch('/src/assets/main.svg');`
    - To: `const response = await fetch('/main.svg');`
    - This ensures the path works in both dev and production builds

13. **Fixed Critical Typo in main.js:**
    - Found typo on line 30: `tsuhis.updateLegend()` (should be `this.updateLegend()`)
    - Fixed the typo to prevent runtime errors
    - This would have caused the app to crash on initialization

14. **Verified Production Build:**
    - Ran `npm run build` - build succeeded
    - Checked `dist/` folder contents:
      - ✓ `index.html` - Entry point
      - ✓ `main.svg` - Brain SVG file copied from public
      - ✓ `assets/index-[hash].js` - Bundled JavaScript with D3.js
      - ✓ `assets/index-[hash].css` - Bundled styles
      - ✓ `assets/index-[hash].js.map` - Source map for debugging
    - Started preview server with `npm run preview`
    - Confirmed app is now accessible at `http://localhost:4173/`

### Current Build Output:
```
dist/
├── index.html (1.57 kB)
├── main.svg (127 kB)
└── assets/
    ├── index-D2q3dFmc.css (4.32 kB)
    ├── index-IThXqFTj.js (43.30 kB)
    └── index-IThXqFTj.js.map (165.02 kB)
```

### Technical Details of Fixes:

**Vite Public Directory:**
- Vite automatically copies everything from `public/` to `dist/` during build
- Files in `public/` are served from the root path `/`
- Perfect for static assets like SVGs, favicons, robots.txt

**File Structure After Fix:**
```
/Users/sami/Documents/nnn/
├── public/              # NEW: Static assets for production
│   └── main.svg         # Brain SVG (copied to dist/)
├── src/
│   ├── assets/          # Source SVGs (kept for reference)
│   │   ├── brain.svg
│   │   ├── brain-1.svg
│   │   └── main.svg     # Original source
│   ├── css/
│   ├── data/
│   │   └── regions.json # Bundled via import
│   └── js/
│       └── main.js      # Updated fetch path + typo fix
└── dist/                # Production build output
    ├── index.html
    ├── main.svg         # Copied from public/
    └── assets/
```

### Production Build Commands:
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server on port 3000

# Production Build
npm run build        # Build for production → dist/

# Test Production Build
npm run preview      # Serve dist/ on port 4173
```

15. **Added regions.json to Public Directory:**
    - Copied `regions.json` from `/src/data/` to `/public/regions.json`
    - Note: JSON is already bundled into the JS via import statement
    - Adding to public/ ensures it's also available as a static file in production
    - This provides redundancy and allows direct access if needed

### Current Status: FIXED ✅

**Production build is now working correctly:**
- [x] SVG file properly included in dist folder
- [x] JSON data file available in dist folder
- [x] Fetch path updated to work in production
- [x] Typo fixed in main.js
- [x] Build completes without errors
- [x] Preview server runs successfully
- [x] All assets correctly bundled and served
- [x] Legend data properly available in production

### Current Build Output (Updated):
```
dist/
├── index.html (1.57 kB)
├── main.svg (127 kB)
├── regions.json (1.5 kB)
└── assets/
    ├── index-D2q3dFmc.css (4.32 kB)
    ├── index-IThXqFTj.js (43.30 kB) - includes bundled JSON
    └── index-IThXqFTj.js.map (165.02 kB)
```

### No Current Failures

The production build setup is now complete. The application can be:
1. Built for production: `npm run build`
2. Tested locally: `npm run preview`
3. Deployed to any static hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)

**Note:** The regions.json data is bundled into the JavaScript file by Vite's import system AND available as a static file in dist/, ensuring maximum compatibility.
